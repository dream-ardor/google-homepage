Google homepage recreation for The Odin Project


From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

**My Notes:**
For this project, we were asked to keep it simple. No need for working links or working forms. However, to challenge myself and make the page more closely resemble the actual Google.com page, I inlcuded working links and a functioning search bar. 

This project is a simple one for anyone with web development experience, but a good learning experience nonetheless. Sometimes, even simple looking projects can challenge you to recall what you've learned and apply the basics properly. This type of project can only serve to remind you of web development principles and how to mimic current sites.

Key takeaways from this project: 

* I learned a few new CSS properties and was reminded of some that I hadn't utilized in awhile by using Developer Tools
* I was also reminded not to overthink, or underestimate, the scope of the project. Approach one section of the problem at a time. 
* Sometimes when you gain momentum, it's tempting to keep adding to your work by making it look better or have more functionality. Do so if you have the time and energy, but the moment you start feeling fatigue, whether mentally or physically, take a break.
* Don't rush. No matter how simple the task may seem, resist the temptation to do just the bare minimum and move on. Try to strike the balance between quick and efficient work and carefully crafted and polished work.
